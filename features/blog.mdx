    │       └── maple.png
    └── mdUtils.tsx              # Markdown rendering utilities
```

## Creating New Blog Posts

To create a new blog post, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Markdown File

Create a new `.md` file in the `app/blog/_assets/articles/` directory. The filename should match the slug you want to use in the URL.

For example, `great-product-ideas.md`:

```md
---
title: "10 Great Product Ideas for Startups"
description: "Explore these innovative product ideas that could be your next successful startup venture."
date: "2024-05-20"
slug: "great-product-ideas"
---

# 10 Great Product Ideas for Startups

Introduction paragraph goes here...

## First Idea: Industry-Specific SaaS

Details about this idea...

## Second Idea: IoT for Home Automation

Details about this idea...

[... more content ...]
```

### 2. Update the Blog Metadata

Add your article metadata to the `articles` array in `app/blog/_assets/content.tsx`:

```tsx
export const articles: articleType[] = [
  // Existing articles...
  
  {
    slug: "great-product-ideas",
    title: "10 Great Product Ideas for Startups",
    description: "Explore these innovative product ideas that could be your next successful startup venture.",
    categories: [
      categories.find((category) => category.slug === categorySlugs.guide)!,
    ],
    author: authors.find((author) => author.slug === authorSlugs.mapleshaw)!,
    publishedAt: "2024-05-20",
    image: {
      src: productIdeasImg, // Import this at the top of the file
      urlRelative: "/blog/great-product-ideas/header.jpg",
      alt: "Product ideas brainstorming session",
    },
    content: (
      <div className="article-content">
        {/* Content will be dynamically loaded */}
        <p>Loading content...</p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
];
```

### 3. Add a Featured Image

Add a header image for your blog post in the `public/blog/[article-slug]/` directory.

## Adding a New Author

To add a new author:

1. Add their avatar image to `app/blog/_assets/images/authors/`

2. Update the `authorSlugs` and `authors` arrays in `app/blog/_assets/content.tsx`:

```tsx
const authorSlugs = {
  // Existing authors...
  newauthor: "newauthor",
};

export const authors = [
  // Existing authors...
  {
    slug: authorSlugs.newauthor,
    name: "New Author Name",
    job: "Job Title",
    description: "Author bio goes here...",
    avatar: newAuthorImg, // Import this at the top of the file
    socials: [
      {
        name: socialIcons.twitter.name,
        icon: socialIcons.twitter.svg,
        url: "https://x.com/username",
      },
      // Other social links...
    ],
  },
];
```

## Adding a New Category

To add a new category:

```tsx
const categorySlugs = {
  // Existing categories...
  tutorials: "tutorials",
};

export const categories = [
  // Existing categories...
  {
    slug: categorySlugs.tutorials,
    title: "Tutorials & How-tos",
    titleShort: "Tutorials",
    description: "Step-by-step guides to help you implement various features and improve your product.",
    descriptionShort: "Step-by-step implementation guides.",
  },
];
```

## Customizing the Blog Layout

The blog layout can be customized by editing the components in the `app/blog/_assets/components/` directory. For example, to modify the appearance of blog cards on the main page, edit `CardArticle.tsx`.

## Markdown Formatting

The blog system uses a custom Markdown renderer that supports:

- Headings (H1-H6)
- Paragraphs and text formatting (bold, italic)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Links
- Images
- Blockquotes

For code blocks, you can use triple backticks with an optional language specifier:

```tsx
// This is a TypeScript code example
function hello(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## SEO Optimization

Each blog post automatically generates:

- Title and meta description tags
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Canonical URLs
- Structured data for search engines

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Publishing**: Regular content updates improve SEO and reader engagement
- **Quality Images**: Use high-quality featured images sized appropriately (1200×630px recommended)
- **Categories**: Use a consistent set of categories to organize your content
- **Internal Linking**: Link between blog posts to keep readers on your site
- **Call to Action**: Include calls to action in posts to drive waitlist signups
