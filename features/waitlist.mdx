## Waitlist Feature Overview

PreLaunch includes a powerful waitlist collection feature that helps you gather email addresses from potential users before your product officially launches, allowing you to build an initial user base. This feature offers:

- Clean, conversion-optimized form design
- Email confirmation notifications through Resend
- Prevention of duplicate submissions
- Integration with Supabase database
- Analytics tracking
- Customizable styles and messaging

## Implementation Methods

PreLaunch's waitlist functionality is implemented using the TypeformWaitlist component:

```tsx
import TypeformWaitlist from '@/components/landing/TypeformWaitlist';

export default function HeroSection() {
  return (
    <div className="hero-section">
      <h1>Your Product Name</h1>
      <p>Short product description</p>
      
      {/* Reference to waitlist section */}
      <Button 
        onClick={() => {
          const waitlistSection = document.getElementById('waitlist');
          if (waitlistSection) {
            waitlistSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
          }
        }}
      >
        Join Waitlist
      </Button>
      
      {/* Waitlist component with ID for scrolling */}
      <div id="waitlist">
        <TypeformWaitlist />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configuring the Waitlist

### Basic Configuration

1. Ensure the necessary environment variables are set in your `.env.local` file:

```
# Supabase configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here

# Email sending (for confirmation emails)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=your_resend_audience_id
```

### Customizing the Waitlist Form

You can customize the waitlist form by editing the `components/landing/TypeformWaitlist.tsx` component:

```tsx
// Customize the component appearance
<div 
  id="waitlist" 
  className="relative bg-white/80 dark:bg-gray-900/80 backdrop-blur-md rounded-2xl shadow-xl border border-gray-200/80 dark:border-gray-800/80 p-6 md:p-8 transition-all hover:shadow-2xl"
>
  {/* Customize content */}
  <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
    Join the Waitlist
  </h3>
  
  {/* Customize description */}
  <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-6">
    Join our waitlist to be among the first to experience our product when it launches.
  </p>
  
  {/* Form implementation... */}
</div>
```

You can also customize the waitlist confirmation messages in the form component or in the translation files.

## Data Storage

User-submitted email addresses are stored in your Supabase database:

### Supabase Schema

The waitlist data is stored in a `waitlist` table with the following structure:

```sql
create table if not exists
  public.waitlist (
    id uuid not null default uuid_generate_v4(),
    email text not null unique,
    locale text not null default 'en',
    source text null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    constraint waitlist_pkey primary key (id)
  );
```

## Backend Implementation

The waitlist feature uses a dedicated API endpoint for handling submissions:

```typescript
// app/api/subscribe/route.ts
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json();
    const { email } = body;

    // Check if email already exists
    const emailExists = await isEmailInWaitlist(email);
    if (emailExists) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { 
          success: true, 
          alreadyExists: true,
          message: "Email already registered in waitlist" 
        }
      );
    }

    // Add to Supabase waitlist
    const result = await addToWaitlist({ 
      email,
      locale,
      source: "website"
    });
    
    // Track signup for analytics
    trackWaitlistSignup(email);
    
    // Send confirmation email
    await sendWaitlistConfirmationEmail({
      email,
      locale
    });
    
    // Return success response
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      success: true,
      message: "Successfully joined the waitlist"
    });
  }
  catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
    return NextResponse.json(
      { success: false, error: "Submission failed" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

## User Confirmation Emails

PreLaunch sends confirmation emails after users register for the waitlist using Resend:

```typescript
// libs/resend.ts
export const sendWaitlistConfirmationEmail = async ({
  email,
  locale = 'en',
}: {
  email: string;
  locale?: string;
}) => {
  try {
    // Render React component to HTML
    const html = await renderAsync(
      React.createElement(WaitlistConfirmationEmail, {
        email,
        locale,
      })
    );

    // Send email with verified domain
    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: config.resend.fromNoReply,
      to: email,
      subject: `Welcome to PreLaunch Waitlist!`,
      html,
      replyTo: config.resend.fromAdmin,
    });

    return { success: true, data };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to send waitlist confirmation email:", error);
    return { error: true, message: "Failed to send email" };
  }
};
```

The default email template is located in `components/emails/WaitlistConfirmationEmail.tsx` and can be customized as needed.
