## Waitlist Feature Overview

PreLaunch includes a powerful waitlist collection feature that helps you gather email addresses from potential users before your product officially launches, allowing you to build an initial user base. This feature offers:

- Clean form design for high conversion rates
- Email confirmation notifications
- Prevention of duplicate submissions
- Integration with MongoDB/Supabase databases
- Customizable styles and messaging

## Implementation Methods

PreLaunch's waitlist functionality can be implemented in two ways:

### 1. Built-in Form

Use the built-in form component to collect user emails:

```tsx
import { ButtonLead } from '@/components/ButtonLead';

export default function HeroSection() {
  return (
    <div className="hero-section">
      <h1>Your Product Name</h1>
      <p>Short product description</p>
      
      {/* Waitlist button */}
      <ButtonLead />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Typeform Integration

Collect richer user information through Typeform integration:

```tsx
import { TypeformWaitlist } from '@/components/landing/TypeformWaitlist';

export default function HeroSection() {
  return (
    <div className="hero-section">
      <h1>Your Product Name</h1>
      <p>Short product description</p>
      
      {/* Typeform waitlist */}
      <TypeformWaitlist />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configuring the Waitlist

### Basic Configuration

1. Ensure the necessary environment variables are set in your `.env.local` file:

```
# Basic database connection (choose one)
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
# or
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Email sending (optional, for confirmation emails)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

### Customizing the Waitlist Form

You can customize the waitlist form by editing the `components/ButtonLead.tsx` file:

```tsx
// Customize button text
<Button text="Join Waitlist" />

// Customize success message
<ButtonLead successMessage="Thanks for signing up! We'll be in touch soon." />

// Customize styles
<ButtonLead className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600" />
```

### Using Typeform Integration

If you prefer to collect more detailed user information using Typeform, follow these steps:

1. Create a form on [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)
2. Add your Typeform credentials to the `.env.local` file:

```
TYPEFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_typeform_access_token
TYPEFORM_WAITLIST_FORM_ID=your_waitlist_form_id
```

3. Use the `TypeformWaitlist` component instead of the default `ButtonLead` component

## Data Storage

User-submitted email addresses will be stored in your configured database:

### MongoDB Schema

If using MongoDB, data will be stored with the following schema:

```typescript
interface WaitlistUser {
  email: string;
  name?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  source?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Supabase Schema

If using Supabase, data will be stored in a `waitlist` table with a structure similar to:

```sql
CREATE TABLE waitlist (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  source TEXT,
  metadata JSONB
);
```

## User Confirmation Emails

PreLaunch supports sending confirmation emails after users register for the waitlist. To enable this feature:

1. Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in your `.env.local` file
2. Edit the email template in `libs/resend.ts`

The default email template is located in `components/emails/WaitlistConfirmation.tsx` and can be customized as needed.
