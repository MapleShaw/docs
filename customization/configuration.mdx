## Configuration Overview

PreLaunch uses a central configuration file to manage application settings. This makes it easy to customize your application without diving into the code. The main configuration file is `config.ts` in the root directory.

## Core Configuration File

The `config.ts` file contains all the main settings for your application:

```typescript
// config.ts
import { ConfigProps } from "./types/config";

const config = {
  // REQUIRED
  appName: "PreLaunch",
  // REQUIRED: a short description of your app for SEO tags
  appDescription: "Focused on product validation phase, helping you quickly deploy a professional website, validate product ideas and collect potential user feedback.",
  // REQUIRED (no https://, not trailing slash at the end, just the naked domain)
  domainName: "prelaunch.online",
  
  // Other configuration sections...
} as ConfigProps;

export default config;
```

## Main Configuration Sections

### Basic Information

```typescript
appName: "PreLaunch",
appDescription: "Your app description here",
domainName: "yourdomain.com",
```

These settings are used throughout the application for SEO tags, page titles, and metadata.

### Customer Support (Crisp)

```typescript
crisp: {
  // Crisp website ID. Set to empty string if you don't use Crisp
  id: "YOUR_CRISP_ID",
  // Hide Crisp by default, except on route "/". Crisp is toggled with <ButtonSupport/>
  onlyShowOnRoutes: ["/"],
},
```

PreLaunch integrates with [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/) for customer support chat. You can enable or disable it here.

### Payment Configuration (Paddle)

```typescript
paddle: {
  plans: [
    {
      priceId: "pri_01jrqpcg09vwepwkfxt1by8np3",
      id: "template",
      icon: "/assets/icons/paddle-icon.svg",
      features: ["Complete landing page template", "SEO optimization", "Waitlist functionality", "High performance loading", "User survey form", "Free updates", "Responsive design", "Source code access", "Dark mode support", "Developer support"],
      name: "Complete Package",
      description: "Get all features, one-time payment, lifetime access",
    },
    // Add more plans here
  ],
},
```

Configure your pricing plans, features, and Paddle price IDs here. Each plan should have a unique ID and a valid Paddle price ID.


### Email Configuration (Resend)

```typescript
resend: {
  // REQUIRED — Email 'From' field to be used when sending magic login links
  fromNoReply: `PreLaunch <noreply@prelaunch.online>`,
  // REQUIRED — Email 'From' field to be used when sending other emails, like abandoned carts, updates etc..
  fromAdmin: `Team at PreLaunch <team@prelaunch.online>`,
  // Support email shown to customer. Leave empty if not needed
  supportEmail: "support@prelaunch.online",
},
```

Configure your email sender information for transactional emails. PreLaunch uses [Resend](https://resend.com/) for email delivery.

### Theme Configuration

```typescript
colors: {
  // The DaisyUI theme to use. Leave blank for default (light & dark mode)
  theme: "",
  // This color will be reflected on the whole app outside of the document
  main: "#3b82f6",
},
```

Set your application theme and primary color here. PreLaunch uses [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for theming.

### Authentication Configuration

```typescript
auth: {
  // The path to log in users. Used to protect private routes
  loginUrl: "/api/auth/signin",
  // The path to redirect users after successful login
  callbackUrl: "/",
},
```

Configure your authentication routes and redirect URLs.

## Environment Variables

In addition to the `config.ts` file, PreLaunch also uses environment variables for sensitive information. These should be set in your `.env.local` file:

```
# Basic Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

# Database (MongoDB)
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Paddle Payment
PADDLE_SANDBOX=true
PADDLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
PADDLE_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN=your-paddle-client-token-here

# Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_ga_id
```

## Creating a Custom Configuration Type

PreLaunch uses TypeScript for type safety. If you need to extend the configuration with new properties, you should update the `ConfigProps` type in `types/config.ts`:

```typescript
// types/config.ts
export interface ConfigProps {
  appName: string;
  appDescription: string;
  domainName: string;
  // Add your new properties here
  myCustomConfig?: {
    setting1: string;
    setting2: number;
  };
  // Other existing properties...
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Sensitive Information in Environment Variables**: Never put API keys, secrets, or passwords in `config.ts`
- **Use Strong NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: This value should be a long, random string to secure authentication
- **Review All Required Fields**: Make sure all fields marked as "REQUIRED" are filled in
- **Use Development/Production Environments**: Use different values for development and production environments

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I add a new pricing plan?">
    Add a new object to the `plans` array in the `paddle` section of `config.ts`. Make sure it has a unique `id` and a valid Paddle `priceId`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I change the primary color of the application?">
    Update the `main` color in the `colors` section of `config.ts`. Use a valid hex color code (e.g., "#ff5500").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I update SEO information?">
    Change the `appName` and `appDescription` in `config.ts`. These will be used for default SEO tags throughout the application.
